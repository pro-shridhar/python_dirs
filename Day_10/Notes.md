First Class functions in Python

In Python, functions are treated as first-class objects. This means they can be used just like numbers, strings, or any other variable. You can:

-->Assign functions to variables.
-->Pass them as arguments to other functions.
-->Return them from functions.
-->Store them in data structures such as lists or dictionaries.
